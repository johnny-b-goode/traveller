# Computers

## Summary

A brief explanation of the change(s).

## Edits

Descriptions of how various rule books would be edited to implement the rule(s) described.

### Book

Description(s) of change(s)

## New Rules

- The processing score for a computer is in addition to the processing power needed for Jump Control programs, and all Jump Control software is included in the price of the computer (basically, all computers function like the Computer Cores in High Guard).
> NOTE: This eliminates the need for Jump Control Specialization (/bis).
- The Jump Control Specialization option (/bis) is no longer available.
- All ships computers are treated as having the Hardened Systems (/fib) option by default. This option is no longer available for purchase with ship's computers.
- Reduce price of all software by 75%

## Stat Changes / Adjustments

See the *computers* tab in house_rules-tables.ods.

## Description

A detailed description of any changes, if needed.

### Background / Flavor / Lore

Beyond TL 8, computers are so powerful that for most intents and purposes their computational power is infinite.

### Ramifications

Ramifications of these changes are far reaching. 

## Justification

In general, the way the game tries to handle computers does not make sense. This applies to ship's computers as well.

### Background

With a few relatively recent exceptions, all computers used in professionally produced spaceborne systems in the present day are EM and Radiation hardened (space is not a friendly place in that regard). It is unlikely that this practice would cease in the future.

Humanity can already produce computers capable of doing almost everything described in any of the Traveller books I have seen so far, easily. Whether or not this holds true for things like jump calculations is anybody's guess, but even if this were a particularly difficult problem the impact would be limited to this particular problem space.

The trend in reality has been for computers to increase in capability for a given price point. Computers of the future can reasonably be expected to continue this trend. One of the impacts of this is that the primary limitation for shipâ€™s computers should be TL, not cost.

Another issue is that the caps on processing power are arbitrary (ie, there are no non-ship computers greater than /5). Additional discrepencies with current computer technology include:
- There is no concept of modularity at all (despite the game specifically mentioning that ship's computers are distributed but have a central core [Core Rulebook, page ?; High Guard, page 63]).
- Item 2

Computers esentially have infinite storage:
>"Note that the storage capacity of computers is not used in Traveller as, beyond TL 8, the capacity of even a modest computer is effectively unlimited."

I agree with this mechanic, but software cannot be copied because "it's too big" (I believe this reference is in the core rulebook). This makes no sense. A more logical reason software cannot be copied would be because its licensed, or locked to a hardware device (both models used in present day reality).

### Analysis

Any analysis done to justify the change, or as part of developing the new systm or rule(s).
