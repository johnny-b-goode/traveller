Unordered List

- A player may re-roll any roll that is the same as the previous roll of the same type (ie, skill, event, benefit, etc.). This prevents snowballing as a result of a couple or few rolls.
- Contacts / Allies and Rivals / Enemies is limited to three in character creation.
- The Entertainer option is not available as a career.
- The Believer option (Traveller Companion, page 36) is not available as a career.
- Connections are done at the very end of character creation.
- Players have the option to start with all stats at 7, or roll stats.
- Players start with two (2) re-rolls if they do not roll stats, and three (3) re-rolls if they do.
- Any time a player rolls stats and the total is less than 36, they can simply start over (resetting re-rolls as well).
- There is no skill level limit in character creation (meaning characters can be greater than level 3)
- When gaining a skill, if a level is listed, then you gain the skill at that level so long as it is higher than your current level in the skill, otherwise, simply gain the skill or a level in the skill.
- A natural 12 on an advance roll is a double advance (see also: updated tables).
- Any mishap or other occurance that eliminates a players benefit rolls is ignored.
- Players can roll, then select whether they want the cash or the benefit.
- The players may start with only one *jump capable* ship. There is no limit on shuttles, fighters, etc.
- Unless otherwise noted, if a player chooses ship shares in lieu of a ship benefit they receive 3 + D6 ship shares. This option is only available if another player has received a jump-capable ship as a benefit.
- Players have the option to convert ownership benefits into ownership of the same ship, following the rules below:
	- No character can own a larger percentage of the ship than the player who originally received the ship as a benefit. After character creation the players may change ownership stakes as they agree to do so.
		- If multiple players *of the same profession* each receive a ship benefit, they may each have a stake (based on the number of benefits received) in the same ship. This is the only time a player may end up with a larger stake in a ship than the player who originally rolled it as a benefit. This simply represents the other players having stakes in the ship of the player who ended up with the largest stake in a ship as a result of benefits.
	- If the players roll ship benefits in excess of 100% ownership, they convert (jump capable) ship benefits into ship shares as indicated above.
- Players can choose to roll 1D times on the Spacecraft Quirks table (Core Rulebook, page 188), OR roll three times (the weighted average of 1D).
