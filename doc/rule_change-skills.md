## Stat Changes / Adjustments

Any updates to stats arising from the implementation of this rule / change.

## Description

A detailed description of any changes, if needed.

### Background / Flavor / Lore

Further explanation, discussion of mechanisms of action, technologies involved, social forces in play, etc.

### Ramifications

Heavy weapons will need to have their types converted to the appropriate weapon type: Archaic, Energy, or Slug.

## Justification

What are the reasons for this change / overhaul. Include any supporting references or discussions contributing to your reasoning.

### Background

Given the mechanics of how language is dealt with in the setting, the language skill is fairly low value. Any time the "Language" skill is rolled, reroll. Alternatively, a player may replace the language skill with another skill before rolling for skills in that profession for the first time. The chosen skill is used throughout the remainder of the career.

Carouse would simply be charisma in other games. It seems way easier to just use the SOC characteristic, though I guess this is supposed to represent social standing not social skill. If the system were converted to a Charisma-based system (instead of social standing) this would easily be eliminated.

A weapon's fundamental nature does not change because it is mounted to a vehicle or pintle instead of a tripod. "Portable" and "Vehicle" should be changed to reflect the weapon type: Archaic, Energy, Slug.

Screen - Activating and using a ship's energy screens like Black Globe generators or meson screens.
1. If this is not a gunnery skill, which it certainly does not seem to be, it should fall under it's own skill.
2. Turning something on requires a skill check? Pushing a button / flipping a switch requires a skill check? I can see something sufficiently complicated requiring a skill check, but if that is the case there needs to be a narrative explanation of why.
3. If this should apply to things like sand casters, that makes sense.
