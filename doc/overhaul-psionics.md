## Core Rulebook Update 2022

- **Page 228** - Change first paragraph to read as follows:

	*In Traveller, few humans (and aliens) have developed psionic abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis, and even teleportation. Learning to properly control psionics is never easy, and their use cannot always be relied upon, but psionic potential is latent within the majority of humaniti. The rarity of psionic ability is far more the result of lack of training than the lack of ability.*

- **Page 228** - Change third paragraph, under PSIONIC STRENGTH, to read as follows:

	*Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength (PSI) characteristic. This characteristic is rolled in secret (by the referee) during character creation, and then recorded by the referee. This information is not shared with the players unless one of them takes the Psion career. This career may not be taken without the referee's permission, even if rolled. To determine a Traveller's PSI, roll 2D. If a Traveller does not develop or use their psionic potential, it will diminish over time. When the Traveller reaches the age of 20, decrease the Traveller's PSI score by one point if the Traveller has not received any psionic development or training. Decrease the Traveller's PSI score by one additional point for every whole decade above 20, in which the Traveller has not actively trained or developed their psionic potential (to a minimum of zero). When a Traveller begins developing their psionic potential, these reductions cease.*

- **Page 228** - Change seventh paragraph, under INSTITUTE TESTING, to read as follows:

	*The first step is testing a Traveller's PSI. Through this process (and potentially others) the Traveller learns of their psionic potential, and the referee reveals to the Traveller their previously determined PSI score (minus any reductions due to age).*

- **Page 228** - Change eighth paragraph, under INSTITUTE TESTING, to read as follows:

	*The duration and cost of training is up to the referee, and should make sense given the setting and Traveller's background. As part of training, the Traveller may attempt to learn any of the common psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making a PSI check. They may attempt the talents in any order by suffer DM -1 per check attempted. If a Traveller learns a talent, they gain it at skill level 0.*

- **Page 229** - Add after third paragraph, under PSIONIC TALENTS, to read as follows:

	**Metaconcert**
	*There is at least one basic power that is posessed by all psions, *Metaconcert*. Metaconcert is most easily described as a form of focused meditation in which multiple minds can be joined for the purpose of accomplishing a collective goal. Metaconcert will be focused on a specific individual, the conductor, who will direct the aggregate psionic energy.

	Metaconcert must be actively established by the Travellers before it can be used. It is not a reactive ability that can be instantly engaged and disengaged. Establishing a metaconcert requires a minimum of two participants (one conductor, and at least one contributor), and 1D3 rounds *per participant* (including the conductor). No other action may be taken by the Travellers while establishing the metaconcert, or by contributing Travellers once the metaconcert is established. Additional Travellers may contribute to the metaconcert in 1D3 rounds once it has been established, and so long as there are at least two Travellers participating the metaconcert will continue. If a Traveller receives damage while contributing to a metaconcert, they must succeed on an average (8+) PSI roll to remain in metaconcert. If a Traveller is rendered unconscious, they automatically cease to contribute to the metaconcert.

	To contribute to metaconcert, a Traveller rolls an average (8+) PSI check. The contributing Traveller then adds or subtracts the effect of the roll to an amount of PSI points chosen by the contributing Traveller, up to a maximum of half of their PSI score. Metaconcert must be actively maintained, meaning a Traveller may perform no other actions while contributing to metaconcert. 

	The conductor then adds the contributed PSI points to their own PSI score. These contributed PSI points remain available so long as the Traveller(s) maintain metaconcert. There is no upper limit on the amount of psionic strength (number of PSI points) that may be aggregated.

	> NOTE: While in metaconcert there is a collective shield applied to the entire group. If metaconcert is used in conjunction with the Shield power,it may be applied to the group in metaconcert, individuals outside the group, or a combination of the group and individual(s) (within reason, referee's discretion).*

- **Page 230** - Add after 2nd paragraph, under TELEPATHY, to read as follows:
	**Cloud**
	*The ability to cause a sophont to become befuddled, confused, or forgetful. There are rumors that at higher levels it can even allow a telepath to render themselves invisible.

	Check: Average (8+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)  
	Reach: Medium  
	PSI Cost: 2*  

- **Page 230** - Change 8th - 10th paragraphs, under Telempathy, to read as follows:

	*The communication of emotions and basic feelings is accomplished by telempathy. This ability serves well in the handling of animals and beasts of burden but may also be applied against sophonts. Sending of emotions such as love, hate, fear and others may inﬂuence other beings (although not necessarily in the manner desired). The change in mood may be dramatic and inexplicable, and if the telepath is fortunate, be ascribed to the mercurial nature of emotions.

	Telempathy also allows the emotions and feelings of others to be read by a Traveller. Sophonts may recognise when someone is using Telempathy to bend their emotions, but other telepaths will always recognise when Telempathy is used against them. If the effect is recognized it can be resisted, and in many cases the emotions can simply be ignored altogether.

	The Effect of the Telepathy check is used to judge the strength of the emotion projected.

	Check: Average (8+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)  
	Reach: Medium  
	PSI Cost: 1*

- **Page 230** - Remove Send Thoughts

- **Page 231** - Remove Assault

- **Page 231** - Change first paragraph, under Suggestion, to read as follows:

	*The telepath implants a thought, idea, or command into the mind of another. It is quite possible for even non-psions to recognize the thought as not their own, so if the suggestion is plainly harmful the subject may not follow the command or act upon the idea. Self-destructive suggestions will rarely, if ever (and never knowingly), be followed.

- **Page 232** - Add after 9th paragraph, under TELEKINESIS, to read as follows:

	**Audiokinesis**
	*The ability to manifest sounds. This is not sound as perceived by a specific sophont (such as one's inner monologue), but actual sound perceptible by anyone within range. This effect does require an atmosphere to work, with the thickness of the atmosphere impacting the propagation of sound waves in the normal ways.

	| Telekinesis Effect | Audiokinesis Outcome                                                                   |
	| --------           | -                                                                                      |
	| -2                 | single tone                                                                            |
	| 0                  | louder noises                                                                          |
	| 2                  | multiple tones (ie, a chord)                                                           |
	| 4                  | complex sounds (ie, a voice)                                                           |
	| 6+                 | powerful sounds (ie, sounds that can be felt, such as nearby thunder, or an explosion) |

	Check: Average (8+) Telekinesis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)  
	Reach: Medium  
	PSI Cost: 2*

	**Optokinesis**
	*The ability to manifest light. This is not a visualization targetted at a single sophont or group of sophonts, but an actual manifestation of light. This effect is limited to the frequencies of light in and near the visible spectrum for the species using the talent (ie, for a human the visible light spectrum, near infra-red, and near ultra-violet).

	| Telekinesis Effect | Optokinesis Outcome             |
	| --------           | -                               |
	| -2                 | faint glow                      |
	| 0                  | random lights                   |
	| 2                  | bright lights                   |
	| 4                  | specific images (ie, illusions) |
	| 6+                 | laser beam                      |

	Check: Average (8+) Telekinesis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)  
	Reach: Medium  
	PSI Cost: 2*

- **Page 232** - Remove Flight

- **Page 232** - Add after 11th paragraph, under Flight, to read as follows:

	**Fortitude**
	*By channelling psychic energy to their skeletal structure and boosting their healing rate, the Traveller can enhance their ability to absorb damage. Fortitude lasts a number of rounds equal to the Effect of the Awareness check and provides Protection equal to half the number of PSI points expended. Fortitude stacks with worn armour.

	Check: Difficult (10+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI)  
	PSI Cost: Twice the amount of Protection  

- **Page 233** - Change third paragraph, under Pyrokinesis, to read as follows:

	*By exciting or depressing the substance of an object, the Traveller can raise or lower its temperature, possibly even causing it to burst into flames or freeze solid.*

	| Telekinesis Effect | Pyrokinesis                                                            | Cryokinesis                                                                             |
	| --------           | -                                                                      | -                                                                                       |
	| -2                 | Becomes warmer but is undamaged.                                       | Becomes cooler but is undamaged.                                                        |
	| 0                  | Boiling water or warming food.                                         | Freezing water or chilling food or drink.                                               |
	| 2                  | Is burned, suffering 1D damage.                                        | Is partially frozen, suffering 1D damage.                                               |
	| 4                  | Is burned, suffering 2D damage and may burst into flames if flammable. | Suffers 2D damage and may be embrittled or frozen (slowing or immobilizing the target). |
	| 6+                 | Is burned, suffering 2D damage and bursting into flames if flammable.  | Suffers 2D damage and embrittled or frozen (slowing or immobilizing the target).        |

	Check: Routine (8+) Telekinesis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)  
	Reach: Short  
	PSI Cost: 3*

- **Page 233** - Change Pyrokinesis to Thermokinesis

- **Page 233** - Change 9th paragraph, under Enhanced Strength, to read as follows:

	*PSI points may be converted to STR points on a temporary basis. The Traveller makes the commitment, reduces their available PSI by a specifed number of points and increases their STR characteristic by half the number of PSI points spent. STR reaches its new level immediately, remains at that peak for number of minutes equal to the Effect of the Awareness check x 10 and then declines at the rate of one point per minute until the Traveller’s normal STR is reached.*

	Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI)
	PSI Cost: STR increase x 2

- **Page 233** - Change first paragraph, under Enhanced Endurance, to read as follows:

	*PSI points may be converted to END points on a temporary basis. The Traveller makes the commitment, reduces their available PSI by a specifed number of points and increases their END characteristic by half the number of PSI points spent. END reaches its new level immediately, remains at that peak for number of minutes equal to the Effect of the Awareness check x 10 and then declines at the rate of one point per minute until the Traveller’s normal END is reached.*

	Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI)
	PSI Cost: END increase x 2

- **Page 232** - Remove Fortitude

- **Page 234** - Change first paragraph, under Regeneration, to read as follows:

	*Wounds may be healed by the application of this power, exchanging two PSI points to regenerate one lost characteristic point. Should one session of healing be insufcient, further healing and regeneration may be applied after expended PSI is recovered. Regeneration may also be applied to heal old wounds suﬀered prior to psionic training. Regeneration may not be used to counteract ageing, nor may it be used to regain lost SOC.*

	Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D minutes, PSI)
	PSI Cost: Amount healed x 2

- **Page 234** - Change 3rd through 6th paragraphs, under Teleportation, to read as follows:

	*Teleportation is a talent that allows effectively instantaneous movement from one point to another, without regard for intervening matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement of the teleported Traveller's body and typically up to 10 kg of clothing and equipment.

	Teleportation requires a considerable amount of PSI energy, more than most sophonts are capable of producing without some form of augmentation. This means teleportation is typically only accomplished using PSI enhancing technologies and / or metaconcert.

	Check: Average (8+) Teleportation check (1D seconds, PSI)
	Reach: Distant
	PSI Cost: 30

	To teleport with armor or up to 500kg of equipment or other sophonts (or up to 500kg of equipment minus the armor), the Teleportation check is increased to Very Difficult (12+) and costs additional PSI points equal to 50% of the base cost.*

## Stat Changes / Adjustments

Any updates to stats arising from the implementation of this rule / change.

## Description

A detailed description of any changes, if needed.

### Background / Flavor / Lore

The commonality of psionic potential is inconsistent with the rarity of psionic practitioners. This could be the result of simple ignorance, albeit incredibly widespread. A potentially more plausible explanation is that there is an ongoing conspiracy, or conspiracies, to suppress psionics.

Psionics Conspiracies:
- **Imperium** - The only thing in the Imperium suppressed more than psionics is the knowledge that most humans possess some level of psionic capacity. If the population at large were to realize that most humans have latent psionic potential, either a majority of the population would have to be despotically surpressed, which at best could only be maintained for a short time, or imperial society would be completely upended. At least according to those who do have this knowledge.
- **Zhodani Consulate** - Because Zhodani society is structured based on psionic potential, it may well cause large scale societal upheaval if it became common knowledge that most humans have latent psionic ability.
- **Solomani Sphere** - The Solomani would have known about psionics long before the discovery of the jump drive. Would they still remember this information? Would it now be suppressed for some reason?
- **Sword Worlds** - The Sword Worlders do not actually have any ongoing conspiracies to suppress the knowledge of psionic potential among humans. The sword worlders themselves do not generally take enough interest in psionics, viewing the subject more as a curiosity than anything, to make any such suppressions necessary. If anything, they might be victims of the Zhodani and to a lesser degree Imperial conspiracies.
