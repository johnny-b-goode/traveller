# Missiles

## Summary

Changes to missiles to reflect a more likely future concerning use of missiles in high technology settings, particularly in space combat.

## Edits

### Core Rulebook Update 2022

Page 171, Point Defence (Gunner)
Remove the third sentence of the first paragraph. Change the fourth sentence to read:
	A gunner may attempt Point Defence on any number of missile salvos in a round, suffering a cumulative DM-1 for every attempt after the first (the second attempt would be DM-1, the third DM-2, etc.).

### High Guard

Page 33, Point Defence Batteries
Replace table at bottom of page with table indicated in Stat Changes.
	
### Vehicle Handbook

Page 49, Anti-Missile System
Replace table at bottom of page with table indicated in Stat Changes.

## New Rules

- Any missile fired at a spacecraft from within an atmosphere with a code greater than 4 is assumed to either be incapable of reaching the target or to have burned up before doing so.
- Any missile fired from greater than Close range is automatically assumed to have failed, been outmaneuvered, run out of fuel, jammed, or destroyed. No EWar or Point Defense rolls are required.
- Any point defence system or action (use ship TL for Gunners performing a Point Defence reaction) gains DM+1 per TL above 8, in addition to any other bonuses.
- If a missile is fired within Close range it may survive long enough to strike the target. If the firing vessel does not have a position of advantage in a dog fight, then EWar may be performed normally, and point defence (automated or manual) may be performed with an additional DM+2.
- If the firing vessel does have a position of advantage in a dog fight, then EWar and point defence may both be performed normally. If the attacker won the last dogfight roll, point defence is performed with DM-2 for every 4 point difference in effect (an effect of 4 would be DM-2, 8 would be DM-4, etc.).

## Description

A detailed description of any changes, if needed.

### Background / Flavor / Lore

Further explanation, discussion of mechanisms of action, technologies involved, social forces in play, etc.

### Ramifications

Many ship designs include Missile Racks. Missile Racks may be retained, but will likely be largely ineffective. It may be advisable to replace Missile Racks in any ships used in conjunction with these rules. 

> NOTE: If Missile Racks or Bays are replaced with other weapons, adjust ship cost and space requirements accordingly. Also remember to reallocate space for missile storage to cargo or other systems.

## Justification

The representation of missiles as being commonly used in high technology settings is illogical. In the present day, missiles are already challenged by anti-missile systems. Technological advancements and projects currently under way threaten to make missiles obsolete in coming decades. Projecting these trends and technologies into the future all but guarantees missiles would only be useful in a very narrow set of circumstances in those settings.

###  A Visual Explanation

### Inability to Turn
The law of conservation of momentem states that the momentum of a system is constant if no external forces are acting on the system. Further, the amount of energy required to change the trajectory of a projectile increases as the kinetic energy of the projectile increases.

Missiles used in space combat would have to include some type of inertial dampers to have any chance at all of hitting a ship moving at cosmic speeds. The systems involved to make a missile practically useful would be tremendously expensive (it would basically be a tiny ship with a warhead), making them, at the very least, cost inefficient.

### Insufficient Fuel
If they simply contained chemical reaction engines (rockets) they probably would not be able to carry enough fuel to catch a ship under constant acceleration if there was any significant distance between them (ie, thousands of KM). Even if they could, the flight time would be considerable (dependent on the amount of acceleration, starting velocity, and velocity of target ship). When the engines did eventually run out of fuel, all the target ship would have to do to avoid impact is turn slightly, or simply not stop accelerating.

If the missile contained separate thrusters for maneuvering, which would be likely, the target might be able to force the maneuvering thrusters to maintain a constant burn until the fuel for those thrusters was depleted. In that scenario the missile would be able to continue to accelerate, but would not be able to maneuver to strike the target vessel.

### Point Defences
Neither of the preceding points address the most glaring problem with missiles in an advanced technology (sci-fi) setting: lasers. Kinetic energy weapons with reletivistic velocities also have very significant potential to minimize the threat posed by missile systems.

Existing technologies mitigate this threat:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-in_weapon_system
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/SEQ-3_Laser_Weapon_System
- https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1836495/air-force-research-laboratory-completes-successful-shoot-down-of-air-launched-m/

The game even addresses this in some of the supplements:

- High Guard, page 33, Point Defence Batteries
- Vehicle Handbook, page 49, Anti-Missile System
- Central Supply Catalog, page 36, Anti-Missile System
- This point is reinforced by the fact that some of the grav tank descriptions referencing the inefectiveness of missiles given the capability of their point defences.

### Possible Mitigating Conditions
In very close combat, against an unmassed enemy, if launched from a blind spot in a ship's point defences, missiles might be viable.
