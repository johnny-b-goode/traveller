================================================================================
Training:
================================================================================
I thought about modifying training to take into consideration a character's INT. The idea would be subtract the character's INT DM (or perhaps half their INT DM) from the 8 week baseline. This would mean for characters with a negative DM, they would add (subtracting a negative number) to the eight weeks. I think this may be a bit too aggressive a change, so I think we start with the below and possibly revisit this notion if needed.

Core Rulebook, page 55
	Remove the first sentence of the second paragraph.
	Change paragraph six to the following:
		"Failure indicates the Traveller has not learned enough to increase their skill level, but may try again after another successful Study Period. Travellers gain DM+1 to their next EDU check to learn a skill for every previously failed EDU check attempting to learn that skill."

	The above change means that if a Traveller studies for eight weeks, and fails their EDU check, they gain a DM+1 to their next EDU check. If they study for another period, and fail their EDU check again, they would then gain a DM+2 to their next EDU check. This would continue until the Traveller gains the skill by default (after seven attempts for a Traveller with a DM 0 for EDU), or if the player decides to switch to training another skill.

================================================================================
Task Checks:
================================================================================
Core Rulebook, page 58
	The description under this section is logical, and I think it's appropriate, but inconsistent with other sections in the book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task Difficulties
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Task Difficulty table (Core Rulebook, page 61), all difficulties "below" Average can probably be ignored based on the description on page 58.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effect Results:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core Rulebook, page 61
	The Effect Results table is inherently flawed as it ignores a fairly fundamental concept, in that an average task difficulty is 8+ (see Making Checks, page 58). An effect of zero is equivalent to a success on a task check, so advising the referee that the Traveller "...may have to accept a condition on their success" is not only inconsistent, but HIGHLY likely to be perceived as unfair (and rightly so).

	The stratification of effects is also inconsistent. A 4+ anywhere else is considerable, whereas in the Effect Results one has to be at a 6 for a success to be considered Exceptional, with no variations in-between. I think most experienced GMs will simply interpret the results as they choose to, but this provides no (or worse yet, poor) guidance for new GMs.

See house_rules-tables.ods for alternate table.

================================================================================
Ambushes:
================================================================================
Core Rulebook, page 73
	Contrary to what some believe, an ambush does not guarantee success on the part of the ambusher. This is dependent on numerous conditions, and particularly more applicable in situations involving more than two participants.

	The problem is that the the combination of DM+6 to the ambusher and DM-6 to the ambushee eliminates any possibility of a motivated response by the ambushee. Mathematically speaking:
		The lowest possible roll on 2D is 2 (ignoring any potential negative DM), plus six is eight.
		The highest possible roll on 2D is 12 (ignoring any potential DM), minus six is six.
		This means that unless there are DMs in play, the ambusher is guaranteed to have higher initiative than the ambushee. If that is the case, there is no point in rolling for initiative, simply give the ambusher a free turn.

Change the DMs to +4 for the ambusher, and -4 for the ambushee.

================================================================================
Weapons:
================================================================================
Extreme Range:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is fairly clear that whoever wrote this does not actually have much experience with weapons.

Core Rulebook, page 77
	Remove first paragraph on page
		It is way too simplistic, ignores all of the other factors that would effect this, and the fact that making a shot at 100 yards is actually not that difficult (particularly if using a futuristic weapon firing a laser or very high velocity projectile, or even a modern weapon using a round with a high ballistic coefficient). It also ignores (not so) futuristic technogies like gyrostabilization (which is actually listed as an available weapon modification) aim assisting devices (smart weapon, also an available weapon modification), and other potentially assistive technologies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weapon Linking:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This would actually apply more to vehicles and spacecraft than Traveller carried weapons. When weapons are linked the player has the option to gain the bonus damage OR treat the weapon as having the Auto trait with a number equal to the total number of weapons linked times any existing Auto trait. If a weapon does not have the Auto trait, then it would be treated as Auto 1 for this calculation.

Note that using the Burst Auto mode in this configuration would be the same as linking the weapons normally.

An example would be two weapons without the auto trait being linked, would be treated as a single weapon of that type with Auto 2. If two weapons with Auto 2 are linked, they would be treated as a single weapon of that type with Auto 4.

================================================================================
Medical Treatment:
================================================================================
First Aid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea that first aid can only be applied within one minute of an injury is ludicrous. The requirement for basic medical equipment is somewhat logical, but ignores the realities of applying first aid, and the very real practices of improvisation and austere medicine.

Core Rulebook, page 82
	Change last sentence under First Aid section to read:
		"First aid is benefited by at least basic medical equipment, but austere medicine may always be attempted. If basic medical supplies are not available, the medic suffers a DM-1 to their medic check. First aid can only be successfully applied once."

Spacecraft Operations:
================================================================================
Repairs and Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core Rulebook, page 154
	Note the roll of 2D BEFORE rolling on the Poor Maintenance table.
	Change the check to a 6+ (would probably go lower still).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encounters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core Rulebook, page 155
	Ignore the second paragraph under this section. Only use this for flavor as needed, or if a random adventure is needed (though I believe there is another table for that).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jump Travel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing for Jump
................................................................................
	Considering both the Astrogation check and Jump! checks are easy, ignore them unless there is some circumstance that warrants making the player roll (especially considering that these rolls can literally wipe the group for no reason).

................................................................................
Misjumps
................................................................................
Core Rulebook, page 157
	Any effect worse than -2 is potentially lethal (seriously?), and not just for one player, but the entire crew. A "merciful referee" may simply subject the travellers to jumping into (very) potentially empty space (most likely without any fuel since they just jumped). The travellers could get lucky and end up in the system next door with a way to refuel, but statistically they will end up ~ 12 jumps away.
	THE ONLY REDEEMING thing about this is that with no negative DMs a player should not be able to get an effect of less than -2, unless they are a new player with EDU less than 7 and / or are making an unskilled attempt... at -3...
	Going back to the point under Preparing for Jump, the only reason to even make this a roll is to reinforce the need for the Engineer (j-drive) skill. I can kind of understand that, actually. I think it just bears drilling it into the players that if they attempt jump without a skilled engineer it could literally be a TPK... from... one... bad... roll.

================================================================================
Older Ships:
================================================================================
Purchasing a used ship (outside of the ship benefit) should be akin to purchasing any other used vehicle or vessel. A person does not buy such a thing, especially when the cost is in the millions, without already knowing (or at least having some idea of) it's history and condition.
	Instead of random rolls on the Outdated Ships table, travellers can select the age of the used ship they are looking to buy, and then roll that number of Spacecraft Quirks.

It may still be appropriate to use the Outdated Ships table to determine what a broker or shipyard happens to have available though.

Space Ship Operations:

Life Support Supplies (page 154)
	I misread this previously. It is per stateroom / occupied low berth, plus people who are not in a stateroom / low berth.
