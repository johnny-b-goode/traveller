# Ship Shares
Core Rulebook Update 2022, page 48, 149

According to the established rules:
- Ship shares may not be redeemed for cash.
- Ship shares may be purchased for 1 MCr each.
- Ship shares may, but do not have to*, be applied against a vessel owned, partially owned, or used by the players.
  - If not, ship shares generate Cr1000 of income per year for the owner of the share.

\* I believe this to be correct based on a few different things in the rules.

For a little more clarity on what ship shares are or represent, please consider that ship shares differ slightly from an ownership stake in that:
- Ship shares function as an asset backed security, not a direct investment.
- An ownership stake can be converted to cash, where a ship share cannot.
- Ship shares are effectively bonded (ie, insured).
- Players cannot sell ship shares.

Ships are assumed to be insured, and the cost of insurance is included in the ship's maintenance costs.

If a ship is destroyed:
- Ship shares are paid out 1:1. In other words, the player(s) owning the share(s) lose nothing.
- Any mortgage on the ship is paid off by insurance, meaning any debt associated with the mortgage is absolved.
- If a player owns a stake in a ship (for example, from a career benefit or a cash investment), then the ship should be assumed to be insured. It is, however, up to the GM to determine exactly how much money the player(s) receive(s) from the insurance payout (after the mortgage is paid off).

> NOTE: This system attempts to avoid incurring any additional book keeping (ie, a dedicated insurance payment).

> NOTE: This system motivates Travellers to own their ships via Ship Shares instead of direct ownership, however, converting an ownership stake directly to ship shares requires they already have sufficient cash (essentially, they would issue the share(s) and buy them from themselves, but must perform this transaction through a third party market). More than likely, players would have to sell the ship(s), and convert the cash to ship shares (this is by design).

There is the possibility that a player moves a ship share into some other vessel, which would mean that the share(s) of the ship previously owned by that player are now owned by somebody else! This could be another player (who would have to buy out the ship shares moved), it could be a third party investor (who would be entitled to a cut of the ship's profits), or it could be a bank (in which case this ship would incur a new mortgage).

Ultimately, ship shares provide a mechanism for protecting accumulated wealth, but impose significant limitations on the use thereof. Players not being able to sell ship shares is somewhat arbitrary, but is already well established by existing rules. I think this is done to protect players from themselves (something I am generally very reticent to do), however, in the context of Traveller I think it actually makes sense. This is due in no small part to the importance ships play in the setting, and the frustrations for everybody and extra work for the GM that can arise if players do not have access to a ship or ships.

In keeping with the principles outlined elsewhere, the reason players cannot exchange ship shares for cash should be explained. I belive the following explanation works fairly well.
- Ship shares are a special form of government subsidized investment.
- As intersteller trade is so important for the overall economy governments want to ensure stability in the ownership, operation, and value of spacefaring vessels. An insured ownership program was created (similar to FDIC for deposit accounts) to guarantee the preservation of ownership and encourage investment into spacefaring vessels.
- This program allows for an ownership stake in a vessel to be sold (for cash) as a ship share, but once a ship share is created in this way the process cannot be reversed (this would have a real life analogue in a covenant or deed restriction).
  - Certain requirements must be met for this to occur. This ship must pass an inspection and be appraised before shares can be issued.
  - Once the requirements have been met, a limit to the number of shares that can be issued is set, and any number of shares up to this limit (market value in whole millions) may be issued.
  - If a ship is improved or undergoes refitting, increasing or decreasing its value, the limit to the number of shares is automatically adjusted.
    - If the value of the vessel decreases, shares are moved to a different (random) vessel to bring the total number of shares in the vessel to the limit.
- Creation, sale, purchase, and trade of ship shares is executed exclusively on a government maintained (and regulated) platform. This platform includes a market, but also permits exclusive transactions (making it relatively easy to buy or trade for shares in a specific vessel).
  - The platform itself (technically the government(s) that operate it) maintains a reserve of shares capable of permitting normal transactional volume for an unspecified period of time (the length of that time period is a closely guarded secret).
    - This number would be massive. Basically, it would be near impossible to perform transactions of enough volume to disrupt the market, or run into a situation where ship shares were unavailable or unable to be traded, or rarely, sold.
- If the vessel represented by the ship share is destroyed, the value of the share is payed out (~ 1 MCr), however, this "payout" is immediately used to purchase a share in another ship. From the Traveller's perspective, it is as though they traded for a share in another (random) ship.
- Ship shares are not permitted to be used for settling of debts, or used as collateral, currency, or portfolio assets except as noted below (bankruptcy proceedings, dissolutions, merger or acquisition).
> NOTE: This does not prevent companies from owning or using ships, or ship shares. It simply prevents ship shares being used as a basis for hedge or investment funds. Most companies would prefer their assets to be more liquid anyway, so companies and corporations would have a strong preference for direct ownership of vessels.
- Once created, ship shares can be traded, but cannot be sold except under certain conditions (similar to certain types of bonds, but without a maturation date):
  - Death of the owner if not held in trust or directly bequeathed
  - Bankruptcy proceedings
  - Dissolution of an owning trust or corporation
  - Divesture during a corporate merger or acquisition
  - Ship shares siezed by government entities may be sold after any evidentiary requirements for which they are required have been met
  - Fraudulent, or attempted fraudulent, use of the ship shares (in which case they are more likely to be siezed by authorities)
  - In all cases, sale of ship shares for cash requires government approval
